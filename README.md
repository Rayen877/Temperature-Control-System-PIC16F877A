# Temperature-Control-System-PIC16F877A
This project implements a simple temperature control system using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. It allows the user to set a desired temperature through a numpad, displays current and target temperatures on an LCD screen, and automatically regulates the temperature by activating a heater or a fan based on real-time data from a temperature sensor.

The system is fully simulated in Proteus, making it easy to test and demonstrate without physical hardware.
